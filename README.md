This is a plug-in repository to rethink server less dns. This plug-in is used for command & control purpose, it is triggered on GET request.
eg. example.serverlessdns.com/dntolist/?dn=google.com here dntolist is a command and ?dn=google.com is input to the command for which appropriate result is returned.
